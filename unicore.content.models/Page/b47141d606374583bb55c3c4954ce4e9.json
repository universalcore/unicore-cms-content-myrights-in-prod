It is also an offense to capture any images or distribute them.\r\nAdditionally, under Section 345D it is also an offense to stalk a woman - to repeatedly contact a woman, trying to foster personal interaction against her will; to monitor her use of internet, email or other form of electronic communication; and to spy on her in any manner that results in a fear of violence or serious alarm or distress in the mind of the woman. These are considered very serious offenses upsetting the mental peace of a woman!",
