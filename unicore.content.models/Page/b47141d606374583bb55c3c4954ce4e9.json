It is also an offense for any image captured in these scenarios to be distributed.\r\nAdditionally, under Section 345 D it is also an offense to follow a woman, to repeatedly contact a woman trying to foster personal interaction against her will, to monitor her use of internet, email or other form of electronic communication, and to spy on her in any manner that results in a fear of violence or serious alarm or distress in the mind of such woman. These are considered very serious offenses against the mental peace of a woman!\"",
