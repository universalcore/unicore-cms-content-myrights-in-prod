Evidence begins to disappear within an hour, and most of it is gone after just 3 days. If possible, the survivor should report the case without changing clothing, bathing, changing sanitary pads, eating, brushing teeth, urinating, or anything that erases evidence of the crime. If necessary, the survivor should put all clothing including under garments in a bag along with any personal items that may have been touched by the perpetrator to give to the police.\"",
